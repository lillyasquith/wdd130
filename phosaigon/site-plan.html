      <h3>About us</h3>
      <p>
      Hi! My name is Ly! I am from Vietnam, and I absolutely love to cook. For years after I moved to the United States, I missed the traditional, authentic taste of Vietnamese cuisine. It is very hard to find good restaurants that have that pure taste of home for me. Not only that, I want my children to also have the sensation of what real Vietnamese food should taste like. So, I decided to roll up my sleeves and learn how to cook my favorite dishes! I have done all the research and the more I threw myself into it, the more passionate I have become about cooking. These Southeast Asian flavors take me back to Saigon, the city of my birth, and let me feel that home-cooked fragrant taste again. 
      
      For years now, I have cooked for my family, and they have all been so satisfied with the food that they encouraged me to open a restaurant. The journey has been a long and difficult one, but it has led me to open this online shop. Now, I can offer a taste of Vietnamese Pho noodles and soups to you and your family too! Feel free to contact me below if you have any additional questions about my menu.
