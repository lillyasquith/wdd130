    <p>Hi everyone! I hope we all have a very succesful semester.</p>
    <p>My name is Ly. I am from Vietnam. I currently live in the US with my family. Before I moved to the States, I lived in Japan for almost 2 years, and I loved it.</p>
    <p>I like learning languages. I speak Vietnamese, English and a litle bit of Japanese. Additionally, I like to cook and taste diffrent kinds of food. I enjoy travelling and exploring the world to expand my knowledge.</p>
    <p>I am fascinated by how modern technology can change the world in many different ways. I took a coding class with BYU Pathway, and I really enjoyed it. So now I hope to get my Bachelor's Degree in Applied Technology in the near future.</p>
